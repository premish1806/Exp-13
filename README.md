# Exp-13 Function and Operator Overloading

## Aim:
To demonstrate the concepts of function overloading and operator overloading in C++.

## Software Used:
- Dev c++
  
## Theory:
Function Overloading: Function overloading allows the same function name to be used for different functions with different parameter lists. This helps in using the same function name for different types of operations.

Operator Overloading: Operator overloading allows us to define custom behaviors for C++ operators when applied to user-defined types such as classes. This enhances the functionality of operators for objects.
